IEEE VIP Cup 2022: Synthetic Image Detection

The topic is “Synthetic Image Detection” in which the aim is to distinguish real versus AI-based content in images. Competition is all about designing a strategy for synthetic image detection by relying on image processing and machine learning techniques. The detail task description can be found in VIP_cup2022_doc.pdf.
